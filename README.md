## CSS Animations vs. JavaScript Animations
CSS-based animations such as this one that are based on the transform and opacity properties are run on the GPU in modern browsers and are therfore more performant (for now). However, to create more complex animations that interact with user input JavaScript is necessary. This webpage was an excersise in practicing CSS animations, and I anticipate coming back in the future and working with a library such as Three.js to insert interactivity.
